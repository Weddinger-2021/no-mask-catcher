## Conflict Plan

> **What is the group process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**
*we will do like a pull and the most voted choice for that conflict will be accepted, we support democratizes :D. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing? 2. we will talk to him/her if he/she has any issues or any circumstances, if yes we will assign small tasks to him/her so he/she can follow up with us with an effort they could manage based on the situation, if not, we will know what's her/his problem and encourage him/her to do what he/she likes to, or provide any help they need in order to proceed with other members, if none of this works maybe we will tell the instructor to help us find a better solution.*

*How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful? 3. if we find carelessness and neglecting without any reasonable cause, in this case, we will refer to our instructor in order to not complicate the situation!*



## Communication Plan

> **How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**

*it's optional to communicate on weekends and it will be over zoom , also it depends on our progress , we all prefer that each one of us is going with the group(the most voted decisions) but we are flexible and it's not mandatory to attend on weekends.*
*What is your strategy for ensuring everyoneâ€™s voice is heard? 2. We already discussed this that everyone should be comfortable with his work and free to seek any help no matter what is it and should speak up for any concern he/she has, and the strategy is to work as a friendly environment before anything else that all of us should be kind in it to ensure that everyone is comfortable to tell anything he/she feels.*
*How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up? 3. Everyday at the morning we will ask everyone is he/she has any concerns about any thing related to the work in the day before and the group in general.*



## Work Plan
> *We will use the provided Trello board to assign tasks. The whole group will work on the same functionality until it is finished. Each one will be responsible for a certain task or component. When the functionality is ready, we will assign new tasks for another new one.*


## Git Process
> *We will create a development branch that will be only for staging, and when the functionality is fully implemented and it is ready to go live, we will make a pull request to the main branch. Each one, in the beginning, will be working on their tasks locally, then each one will push their work on a separate branch, and then they will make a pull request to the development branch.*

*One person is required to review the code, which will be pushed to the development branch. Two will be required to merge to the main branch.*
