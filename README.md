## Synopsis: 

* <h3>We will build a project to detect whether the person on  the webcam is wearing a mask or not. We will train the face mask detector model using Keras and OpenCV.</h3>

* <h3>We will Update our No Mask Catcher system with new features and new database, with a real time response and connected to modern UX/UI website.</h3>

### Mission: 

* <h3>Because wearing a mask has become a necessity to limit the spread of COVID-19, we will develop a python program to identify who is wearing a mask and who is not wearing a mask and alert the supervisers about it.</h3>


___



## Features: 

1. Scan a video to detect if the person is wearing a mask or not 

2. Take a screenshot if there's no mask!

3. If there's no mask , Alert the person with 10 seconds audio warning.("Please wear your mask").

4. If the person is in the dataset and is not wearing a mask retrieve his/her info.

5. Send an email notification with the retrieved info (Department , Job title, Job ID) + Date, Time, , Screenshot

6. If the person in not in the dataset , send an email notification with only Date , Time , Screenshot.

## Motivation:

**What is the vision of this product?**

> *We aim that our product will increase people's awareness to follow safety rules and wearing their masks.*


**What pain point does this project solve?**

> *Because wearing a mask has become a necessity  to limit the spread of COVID-19, we will develop a python program to identify who is wearing a mask and who is not wearing a mask and alert the superviser about it.*


**Why should we care about your product?**

> *Our product is a full deticting system that will alert the poerson who is not wearing the mask and retrieve his/her information if they were found in the data-set to notify the authorities by sening an e-mail with his/her information.*
